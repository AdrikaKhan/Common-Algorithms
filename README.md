# Common-Algorithms
Common algorithm implementation as I practice by myself.

Target to complete:
1. Logarithm
2. DFS, BFS, some sort of graph traversal -> DONE
3. Binary Search (comfortable implementing it)
4. Sliding window technique
5. Recursion (in order traversal etc)
6. Inverting binary tree and reverse linked tree
7. Suffix tree (its a data structure)
8. Heaps (min heaps, max heaps -> they have logarithmic value)
9. Dynamic programming
10. Sorting algorithms (all are important but quicksort and mergesort are really important) -> DONE
